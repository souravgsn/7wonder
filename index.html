                        The new Seven Wonders of the World was compiled by popular vote over a six year period by a nonprofit group headed by Swiss adventurer Bernard Weber. In 1999 Weber began collecting suggestions from Internet users around the world. A list of over 200 nominations was narrowed down to 70, and then to 21, and finally to 7. The group reported more than 100 million votes, received via the Internet and cell phone messages.

                    A 4,160-mile wall was built to protect China from invading Huns, Mongols, and other tribes, and to unite fortifications into one defense system. Begun in the 7th century B.C., the barricade took hundreds of years to build, and ranks as the world’s longest man-made structure and is the only one visible from space.

                    Declared a World Heritage Site in 1985, Petra was the capital of the Nabataean empire of King Aretas IV, and likely existed in its prime from 9 B.C. to A.D. 40. The members of this civilization proved to be early experts in manipulating water technology, constructing intricate tunnels and water chambers, which helped create an pseudo-oasis. A number of incredible structures carved into stone, a 4,000-seat amphitheater and the El-Deir monastery have also helped the site earn its fame.

                    The Art Deco-style Christ the Redeemer statue has been looming over the Brazilians from upon Corcovado mountain in an awe-inspiring state of eternal blessing since 1931. The 130-foot reinforced concrete-and-soapstone statue was designed by Heitor da Silva Costa and cost approximately $250,000 to build - much of the money was raised through donations. The statue has become an easily recognized icon for Rio and Brazil.</p>

                    Machu Picchu, an Incan city of sparkling granite precariously perched between 2 towering Andean peaks, is thought by scholars to have been a sacred archaeological center for the nearby Incan capital of Cusco. Built at the peak of the Incan Empire in the mid-1400s, this mountain citadel was later abandoned by the Incas. The site remained unknown except to locals until 1911, when it was rediscovered by archaeologist Hiram Bingham. The site can only be reached by foot, train or helicopter; most visitors visit by train from nearby Cusco.

                    The genius and adaptability of Mayan culture can be seen in the splendid ruins of Chichen Itza. This powerful city, a trading center for cloth, slaves, honey and salt, flourished from approximately 800 to 1200, and acted as the political and economic hub of the Mayan civilization. The most familiar ruin at the site is El Caracol, a sophisticated astronomical observatory.                </p>

                    Rome's, if not Italy's, most enduring icon is undoubtedly its Colosseum. Built between A.D. 70 and 80 A.D., it was in use for some 500 years. The elliptical structure sat nearly 50,000 spectators, who gathered to watch the gladiatorial events as well as other public spectacles, including battle reenactments, animal hunts and executions. Earthquakes and stone-robbers have left the Colosseum in a state of ruin, but portions of the structure remain open to tourists, and its design still influences the construction of modern-day amphitheaters, some 2,000 years later.                </p>

                    A mausoleum commissioned for the wife of Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan, the Taj Mahal was built between 1632 and 1648. Considered the most perfect specimen of Muslim art in India, the white marble structure actually represents a number of architectural styles, including Persian, Islamic, Turkish and Indian. The Taj Mahal also encompasses formal gardens of raised pathways, sunken flower beds and a linear reflecting pool.                </p>

                            Although the ancient statue depicted the titan Helios, male personification of the sun, it has a rather more feminine descendant: the Statue of Liberty in New York, which is based on 19th-century ideas of what the Colossus looked like.

It is said to have been some 45m tall, its walls decorated with sculpted reliefs, and its pyramidal roof crowned with a huge quadriga – a statue of four horses pulling a chariot.

                    <p>This wonder was so celebrated in the ancient world that pharos became the Greek word for lighthouse – as well as in many other languages including French (phare), Italian and Spanish (faro), Portuguese (farol) and even Swedish (fyr) and Bulgarian (far).</p>

                    <p>The original temple was destroyed in a flood in the 7th century BC and its reconstruction burned down by the fame-hungry Herostratus (from whom we get ‘herostratic fame’ – seeking notoriety for its own sake) in c.356 BC. The third and largest phase, begun in 323 BC, created a temple 450ft long by 225ft wide and 60 ft high, with more than 127 columns. It met its final end amidst Gothic raids in AD 268.</p>
                    <p>This was Antipater of Sidon’s favourite ancient wonder. He wrote: ‘When I saw the house of Artemis that mounted to the clouds, [the] other marvels lost their brilliancy, and I said: “Lo, apart from Olympus, the Sun never looked on anything so grand”.’</p>

                    <p>This is the only one of the Seven Wonders that is likely to have been purely legendary – while the gardens were mentioned by both the Greeks and the Romans – including Strabo and Diodorus Siculus – there are no contemporary references in any of the known cuneiform tablets.</p>

                    <p>According to Suetonius, the eccentric Roman emperor Caligula wanted to have the statue brought to Rome so he could replace the god’s head with a sculpture of his own. When his men went to carry out this task, the statue laughed so loudly that their scaffolding collapsed and the workers fled.</p>
